# Imports

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
}

```

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

```go
import "fmt"
import "math"
```
