# Why

[Reference](https://medium.com/@kevalpatel2106/why-should-you-learn-go-f607681fad65)

* Go has goroutines instead of threads.
  * Goroutines have growable segmented stacks.
  * Goroutines have a faster startup time than threads.
  * Goroutines come with built-in primitives to communicate safely between themselves \(channels\).
  * Goroutines allow you to avoid having to resort to mutex locking when sharing data structures.
  * A single goroutine can run on multiple threads. Goroutines are multiplexed into small number of OS threads.
* Compiled language.
  * Performance is almost nearer to lower level languages.
* Neat and clean syntax
  * No classes. Everything is divided into packages only. Go has only structs instead of classes.
  * Does not support inheritance.
  * No constructors.
  * No annotations.
  * No generics.
  * No exceptions.
